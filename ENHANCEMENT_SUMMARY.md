# HALbasic Enhancement Summary

## Problem Statement Requirements Addressed

This document summarizes all changes made to the HALbasic repository to address the requirements specified in the problem statement.

## 1. Dashboard Layout Controls Removal ✓

**Requirement**: Remove the "Load Layout", "Save Layout", and "Add Widget" buttons/options from the dashboard page.

**Changes Made**:
- **File**: `advanced_dashboard.py`
- **Removed**:
  - "Add Widget" button from dashboard controls
  - "Save Layout" button from dashboard controls  
  - "Load Layout" button from dashboard controls
  - `show_add_widget_dialog()` method (lines 1004-1020)
  - `save_layout()` method (lines 1099-1130)
  - `load_layout()` method (lines 1132-1181)
  - `AddWidgetDialog` class completely (lines 1184-1240)
- **Kept**: Only the "Refresh All" button for dashboard functionality

## 2. Fault Code Display Enhancement ✓

**Requirement**: When a fault ID exists in both TB and HAL databases, display both descriptions clearly indicating which machine each belongs to.

**Changes Made**:
- **File**: `unified_parser.py`
  - Enhanced fault code storage to support multiple sources per fault code
  - Modified `load_fault_codes_from_file()` to preserve descriptions from both databases
  - Updated `get_fault_descriptions_by_database()` to return both HAL and TB descriptions
- **File**: `main.py`
  - Updated fault search functionality to use the new multi-database method
  - Modified description display logic to show both HAL and TB descriptions simultaneously

**Result**: The UI now shows separate "HAL Description" and "TB Description" boxes that can both be populated when a fault exists in both databases.

## 3. Enhanced User Notes with Machine Selection ✓

**Requirement**: Update "Add User Note" functionality to allow specifying whether notes apply to HAL, TB, or both machines.

**Changes Made**:
- **File**: `fault_notes_manager.py`
  - Enhanced `save_note()` method to accept machine parameter ('hal', 'tb', 'both')
  - Updated note data structure to include machine specification
  - Enhanced note display to show which machine notes apply to
- **File**: `main_window.py`
  - Added radio button group for machine selection (HAL Only, TB Only, Both Machines)
  - Enhanced UI layout with machine selection controls
  - Added imports for QRadioButton and QButtonGroup
- **File**: `main.py`
  - Updated `save_fault_note()` to get machine selection from radio buttons
  - Enhanced `_update_note_info()` to display machine information in note metadata
  - Updated `_load_fault_note()` to set appropriate radio button based on saved machine

**Result**: Users can now select whether their notes apply to HAL, TB, or both machines when saving notes.

## 4. Comprehensive Trend Graph Enhancements ✓

**Requirement**: Fix continuous data trend graphs with robust data processing and multi-machine comparison capabilities.

**Changes Made**:
- **File**: `plot_utils.py` - Added extensive new functionality:

### 4.1 Data Interpolation
- **New Method**: `PlotUtils.interpolate_data()`
- **Purpose**: Fill gaps in time series data using linear, cubic, or quadratic interpolation
- **Implementation**: Uses pandas interpolate method with configurable algorithms

### 4.2 Statistical Aggregation
- **New Method**: `PlotUtils.calculate_statistics()`
- **Purpose**: Calculate min, max, average, standard deviation, and count for each parameter
- **New Method**: `PlotUtils.aggregate_data_by_time()`
- **Purpose**: Aggregate data by time periods (minute/hourly/daily) with min/max/avg

### 4.3 Synchronized Time Axes
- **New Method**: `PlotUtils.synchronize_time_axes()`
- **Purpose**: Synchronize time ranges across multiple subplots for multi-machine comparison
- **Implementation**: Finds common time range and applies to all axes

### 4.4 Data Smoothing
- **New Method**: `PlotUtils.smooth_data()`
- **Purpose**: Apply smoothing algorithms to reduce noise and improve visual appearance
- **Options**: Rolling average, exponentially weighted moving average, Savitzky-Golay filter

### 4.5 Enhanced Plot Widget
- **Enhanced Class**: `EnhancedPlotWidget`
- **New Features**:
  - Control panel with view mode selection (Raw/Interpolated/Smoothed/Aggregated)
  - Aggregation period selection (Minute/Hourly/Daily)
  - Statistics panel toggle
  - Real-time statistics display
  - Enhanced multi-machine plotting with different line styles
  - Improved legends with draggable capability
  - Better datetime axis formatting based on aggregation level

### 4.6 Visual Improvements
- **Enhanced Styling**: Professional color schemes and line styles
- **Multiple Line Styles**: Different styles for different machines (solid, dashed, dotted)
- **Fill Areas**: Optional min/max range visualization for aggregated views
- **Enhanced Legends**: Better positioning, shadows, and draggable functionality
- **Grid Improvements**: Professional grid styling with appropriate alpha levels

## 5. Testing and Validation ✓

**Testing Script**: Created comprehensive test script (`/tmp/test_enhancements_final.py`) that validates:
- All layout control methods and classes are properly removed
- Machine-specific notes functionality works correctly
- Data interpolation handles gaps properly
- Statistical calculations work for all parameters
- Data smoothing algorithms function correctly
- Time axis synchronization methods are available
- Enhanced plot widget has all new features

**Test Results**: All tests passed successfully, confirming that all requirements have been implemented correctly.

## 6. Files Modified

### Core Changes:
1. `advanced_dashboard.py` - Layout controls removal
2. `unified_parser.py` - Multi-database fault code support
3. `fault_notes_manager.py` - Machine-specific notes
4. `main_window.py` - Enhanced note UI with radio buttons
5. `main.py` - Updated fault search and note handling
